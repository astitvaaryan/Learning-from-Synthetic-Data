# Learning-from-Synthetic-Data
This project explores the potential of using synthetic data generated by advanced generative models to achieve various downstream machine learning tasks. The key idea is to investigate whether synthetic data can be effectively used for applications such as classification, segmentation, etc.

## Overview
With the advancement of generative models like GANs, we can generate an unbounded supply of synthetic data. This synthetic data offers several advantages over traditional fixed real datasets, including enhanced diversity, improved quality, and reduced storage requirements (e.g., BigGAN takes 225MB, while ImageNet requires 150GB). This project aims to harness these benefits to improve model performance and robustness across different applications.
